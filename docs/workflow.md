### workflow:

after entering the mint page the user can connect their wallet and mint an nft

one nft gives the user the right to open their webcam and select a frame to be used to match them an nft that resembles the frame the most, where sending the frame is to be a part of another transaction which is irreversible

upon sending the frame, one of the images is to be bound to the given user and taken out of the pool

if the transaction is successful, the nft is locked irreversibly, in case of the transaction being reverted or cancelled, the user has the right to re-try capturing the right frame and send it over again

one player might mint multiple nft's, as there are less and less nfts in the pool the combinations tend to match the players' appearances less
