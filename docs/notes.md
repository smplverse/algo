### Notes and TODOs (mostly TODOs)

the smpls can have their faces pre-located once the final 7667 is chosen to save time and ensure every one of the smpls faces gets detected

---
implement an evaluation func

later on this shall be all moved to a class interface to be used along with a server

100 mock input images
1000 smpls
tensorboard
store hash of the image uploaded in the address mapping for given indices

in the future will use a dataloader here, 7k pieces is a lot

there is also an option to use a database and the dataloader

also loop could break the loop if there is a good match, good enough to verify

best score is lowest distance

if its not tensorboard then some other logging/monitoring option has to be used
